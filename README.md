## Architecture

### System Components
The project follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: UI components and controllers
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Services and domain logic
3. **Data Access Layer**: Repositories and data models
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, caching, logging

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Material-UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT, Passport.js
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Documentation**: JSDoc, Swagger

### Design Patterns
- Repository Pattern for data access
- Factory Pattern for object creation
- Observer Pattern for event handling
- Strategy Pattern for algorithm selection
- Singleton Pattern for shared resources

## API Reference

### REST API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Request password reset
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Reset password

#### Users
- `GET /api/users` - List users
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user

#### Resources
- `GET /api/resources` - List resources
- `GET /api/resources/:id` - Get resource by ID
- `POST /api/resources` - Create resource
- `PUT /api/resources/:id` - Update resource
- `DELETE /api/resources/:id` - Delete resource

### Request and Response Examples
Detailed examples of API requests and responses can be found in the Swagger documentation at `/api-docs`.

## Development

### Development Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Submit a pull request
4. Code review and approval
5. Merge to `main`

### Code Style
This project follows the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide with some modifications. ESLint and Prettier are configured to enforce the style guide.

```bash
# Check code style
npm run lint

# Fix code style issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Documentation Standards
- Use JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- Update API documentation when endpoints change
- Keep the README updated with new features and changes

## Testing

### Testing Strategy
The project employs multiple levels of testing:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-end tests**: Test complete user flows
- **Performance tests**: Test system under load

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Test Coverage
The project aims to maintain at least 80% test coverage. Coverage reports are generated after running `npm run test:coverage`.

## Deployment

### Deployment Environments
- **Development**: For active development
- **Staging**: For QA and testing
- **Production**: For end users

### Deployment Process
1. **Build**: Create optimized production build
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy**: Choose one of the deployment options:
   - Docker deployment
   - Cloud platform deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Traditional server deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t project:latest .

# Run Docker container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e NODE_ENV=production project:latest
```

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexing for frequently queried fields
- Response caching with Redis
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Connection pooling for database access
- Static asset optimization and CDN usage

### Monitoring
Performance metrics are collected and monitored using:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for dashboards and visualization
- Alerts for performance degradation

## Security

### Security Measures
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Secure headers configuration
- Regular dependency updates

### Security Best Practices
- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Environment variables for sensitive information
- Regular security audits
- Principle of least privilege for API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection errors**: Check database connection settings in `.env`
2. **Authentication failures**: Verify JWT_SECRET is set correctly
3. **Performance issues**: Check database indexes and query performance
4. **Memory leaks**: Monitor memory usage during development

### Debugging
- Use the debug logs: `LOG_LEVEL=debug npm start`
- Check application logs in `logs/` directory
- Use the built-in debugging tools: `npm run debug`

## FAQ

### General Questions
1. **Q: How do I reset my admin password?**  
   A: Use the CLI tool: `npm run admin:reset-password`

2. **Q: How can I back up the database?**  
   A: Run the backup script: `npm run db:backup`

3. **Q: Is there a size limit for file uploads?**  
   A: Yes, the default limit is 10MB, configurable in `.env`

### Technical Questions
1. **Q: Can I use a different database?**  
   A: Yes, adapt the database adapter in `src/adapters/`

2. **Q: How do I extend the API?**  
   A: Create new controllers and routes in their respective directories

3. **Q: How are migrations handled?**  
   A: Migrations use the built-in migration tool, run with `npm run migrate`
